    <p class="firstP">This website is mostly for fun. It tells about some research I did, about my time in Pittsburgh, and shares some photos I took throughout. It may seem like it doesn't all go together, but at the core of it all is <span class="change">change</span>.</p>

    <br>

    <p>The research is quite revolutionary, looking into our genes. With more knowledge of our gene's role in melanoma, we might be able to someday cure or at least better treat melanoma. The idea of the new, the cutting edge, is the same attraction that computer science has. It's like we are building the world of tomorrow, just as happened during the Industrial Revolution, and I want to be a part of it. Don't you?</p>

    <p>I ended up at Pittsburgh for this reason. About a year and a half ago, I was in Scotland at the University of St Andrews. By the end of High School I was bored, having spent my whole life in one town at one school. I wanted as big a change as possible, so I picked St Andrews. The sky there was <span class="blue">bluer than blue</span> whenever it wasn't gray. The ocean rolled up the cliffs, spraying the castle and the ruins of the cathedral. But, I missed the kind of revolutionary feeling I got with the research and looking at the surgery robots. Pittsburgh is still new to me and the guide-like blog on the last page shares my experience with this change.</p>

    <br>

    <p>But hey, Pittsburgh's pretty cool. They say it takes 3 years for this place to grow on you, so if you haven't gotten to that point yet, don't fret! Sometimes it just takes finding the great places in the city to love the place.</p>

    <br>

    <p> Sometimes you don't find those great places until you start playing Pokemon Go and the pokestops lead you to them. Sometimes you've just got to find that park with the view (Schenley in case you were wondering), eat a
    cr&ecirc;pe
    (they are literally everywhere here), or join the right club. In case you didn't already know, there are tons and tons of museums around the place. Haven't gone to the mattress factory? GO! NOW! What about the Phipps Conservatory? You do realize you get in free as a student, right? So, if you hate Pittsburgh, walk outside right now before it starts raining and stop hating it.</p>
